# TXT_to_SRT

This program takes in a TXT file and creates an SRT file with each line of the TXT file display for a specified amount of time

This program takes 3 arguments; the path of the input TXT file, the duration to display each line for in milliseconds, and the path of the output SRT file.

The second two arguments are optional. If the duration is left blank, it will default to 1 second. If the output file is left blank, it will output to a file with the same path and name as the input file, but with a .srt extension.
